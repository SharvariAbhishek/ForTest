## Introduction

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment is downloaded from the course web site

The variables included in this dataset are:

* steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as 𝙽𝙰)
* date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
* interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken


### Loading the required libraries

Load the required libraries to plot the data

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

1. Reading the data

```{r}
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
str(activityData)
```


2. Processing the data for suitable format

```{r}
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
activity <- activityData[complete.cases(activityData), ]
str(activity)
```

### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

1. To calculate the sum of total number of steps taken per day, we use aggregate function.

```{r}
StepsDay <- aggregate(steps~date, activity, FUN = sum)
head(StepsDay)
```

2. Creating an histogram for number of steps taken each day using `hist` function

```{r}
hist(StepsDay$steps, xlab = "Total number of steps taken per day", col = "green", main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day" )
```

3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day

Taking mean and median of steps taken per day using `mean` and `median` function.

```{r}
firstMean <- mean(StepsDay$steps)
firstMedian <- median(StepsDay$steps)
firstMean
firstMedian
```



### Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

1. To subset the average number of steps taken in every intervals of time. 

```{r}
Interval_steps <- aggregate(activity$steps, by = list(activity$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
colnames(Interval_steps) <- list("intervals", "steps")
head(Interval_steps)
```

2. Plotting the average number of steps taken in every interval

```{r}
ggplot(data = Interval_steps, aes(x= intervals, y=steps))+geom_line(col = "red")+xlab("Intervals")+ylab("Number of steps taken")+ggtitle("Time series plot of the average number of steps taken")
```

3. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

```{r}
Interval_steps[Interval_steps$steps == max(Interval_steps$steps), ]
```

4. To clear the workspace
```{r}
rm(Interval_steps)
```

### Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

```{r}
activityData[is.na(activityData$steps), .N]
```

1. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
Dataimputed <- activityData
Dataimputed$steps <- impute(activityData$steps, fun = mean)
head(Dataimputed)
```

2. Make a of total histogram number of steps taken each now

```{r}
StepstakenPerday <- aggregate(Dataimputed$steps, by=list(Dataimputed$date), FUN = sum)
colnames(StepstakenPerday) <- c("date", "steps")
hist(StepstakenPerday$steps, col = "blue", main = "Total steps taken each day after imputing missing values in data",xlab = "Number of steps taken each day" )
```

3. Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per each day after imputing missing values

```{r}
secondMean <- mean(StepstakenPerday$steps)
secondMedian <- median(StepstakenPerday$steps)
secondMean
secondMedian
```

4. To calculate the difference between first Mean & median(number of steps taken each day/ without NA) and second mean & median(Number of steps taken each day after imputing missing values)

```{r}
DifferenceMean = secondMean - firstMean
DifferenceMedian = secondMedian - firstMedian
DifferenceMean
DifferenceMedian
```

5. Total difference between steps taken per each day

```{r}
Difference = sum(StepstakenPerday$steps) - sum(StepsDay$steps) 
# The total difference between imputed data and non imputed data is 
Difference
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day

```{r}
Dataimputed$date <- as.Date(Dataimputed$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
Dataimputed <- data.frame(date = Dataimputed$date, weekday = tolower(weekdays(Dataimputed$date)), steps = Dataimputed$steps, interval = Dataimputed$interval)
Dataimputed <- cbind(Dataimputed, daytype = ifelse(Dataimputed$weekday == "saturday" | Dataimputed$weekday == "sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))
head(Dataimputed)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

```{r}
Dataimputed <- aggregate(Dataimputed$steps, by = list(Dataimputed$weekday, Dataimputed$daytype, Dataimputed$interval), mean)
colnames(Dataimputed) <- c("weekday", "daytype", "interval", "meanSteps")
head(Dataimputed)
```

Plotting the graph

```{r}
ggplot(Dataimputed, aes(interval, meanSteps, color = daytype))+geom_line()+facet_grid(daytype ~ .)+xlab("5 min interval")+ylab("Average steps taken")
```

To clear the work space 
```{r}
rm(firstMedian, firstMean, activity, Dataimputed, StepstakenPerday,StepsDay, Difference, DifferenceMedian, DifferenceMean)
```
